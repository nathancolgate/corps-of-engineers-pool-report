### Project Information and Observations

#### Overview

The development planned for 872 Oak Street will consist of a below ground swimming pool. The project site, located in the City of Lawrence, Douglas County, Kansas, was historically used for agriculture, and has one existing house with a basement. A few trees exist on the property. Some smaller fruit trees will be removed, but the larger shade trees will remain. The project layout is illustrated on Sheet 1, included in Appendix A.

#### Construction

Construction will begin in the spring of 2021 and continue through the summer of 2021. Specific construction activities covered in this report are a pool excavation with a footprint of approximately 2,828 square feet. The periods during which subsurface excavation activities will occur is no greater than 2 weeks.

#### Kansas River Levee Station

The overall project site at its closest point is directly adjacent to the Kansas River levee Station 391+00.

### Subsurface Conditions

#### Soils Information

Soil names, descriptions, formation, classifications, and physical and engineering characteristics were obtained from the _United States Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service -- Soil Survey of Douglas County, Kansas_.

Detached boring information and descriptions of soil types, characteristics from soil samples of those borings, levee elevations, and depth to soil stratum layers  were obtained from the _USACE Plan, Profile and Underground Explorations Sta. 346+00 to Sta. 402+00_ dated May 1969. No subsurface explorations or laboratory testing program were specifically performed for this project.

#### Natural Blanket

The uppermost soil stratum at the site is classified by the Soil Survey and the USACE as a silt loam to silty clay loam (ML, CL) described as Eudora-Bismarckgrove complex. The Eudora series consists of deep, well drained, nearly level to gently undulating soils on flood plains, formed in loamy alluvium and for this report will be considered the blanket material.

This soil horizon varies in thickness but average in depth of 16 to 24 feet and greater. For the purpose of this analysis, the blanket thickness has been estimated at 20 feet, with a bottom elevation of 804.00. This is an average of the observed blanket thickness of boring D-77 at STA 385+10 (16 feet) and boring D-78 at STA 394+10 (24 feet).

The saturated conductivity of Silt Loam (ML) and Silty Clay Loam (CL) is between 0.45 and 0.07 cm/hour. However, an on-site percolation test was conducted at a depth of 3 feet, and found the soil to have a rate of 3.81 cm/hour (more akin to sandy loam soil). For this analysis, the conductivity of loamy sand (1.04 cm/hour) will be used for the vertical permeability of the impervious natural blanket.

#### Natural Foundation

The underlying soils for the project site are classified by the Soil Survey as sandy and loamy deposits described as the Riverwash and Sarpy Series Overwash with outcroppings near the lowest level along the Kansas River. This soil horizon varies in thickness but detached borings indicate that the pervious zone averages 30 to 40 feet in thickness. For the purpose of this analysis, the pervious substratum thickness has been estimated at 35’.

#### Kansas River Observations

Kansas River information was obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Weather Service -- Kansas River at Lawrence Flood Stage Gauge located approximately 6,200 feet upstream of the project. 

The most recent water surface elevation at the Kansas River gauge in Lawrence at the time of this report (July 28, 2020) indicated a stage of 13.71 feet with the gauge base elevation at 799.86 feet. The gauge is located at the Highway 59 Bridge connecting 6th and Massachusetts Streets to North Second Street just upstream of the Bowerstock Dam.  

> Source: Hydrograph for Kansas River at Lawrence Flood Stage Guage [http://water.weather.gov/ahps2/hydrograph.php?wfo=top&gage=lwrk1](http://water.weather.gov/ahps2/hydrograph.php?wfo=top&gage=lwrk1)

The Kansas River normal water elevation below the Bowersock Dam adjacent to the site may vary from 790 to 800 feet above sea level. 

#### Kansas River Flood Impacts

* **34 feet:** Flood waters reach the top of the levee on north side of the river.
* **32.3 feet:** The city of Lawrence Wastewater Treatment building is flooded.
* **28 feet:** Water enters the first floor of the Lawrence Riverfront Mall.
* **27.3 feet:** The City of Lawrence Wastewater Treatment Plant is shut down.
* **21.3 feet:** Sandbagging of the City of Lawrence Waste Water Treatment Plant is necessary.
* **18 feet:** Lowlands outside of the levee on the north side of the river begin to flood. Burcham Park is closed due to flooding on the south side of the river.
* **15 feet:** Burcham Park on the south side of the river begins to flood.

While the Kansas River at Lawrence Flood Stage Gauge is upstream of the project, the uniform cross-section of the river would indicate that the relative depth of the flood water to height of levee would be equivalent to the section at the project location.  Based on relative elevation of the project site, Kansas River flood stage would need to be at 29 feet to recognize a groundwater elevation equivalent to the lowest point on the crest of the project site levee.

#### Ground Water Observations

Ground water levels were estimated based on information provided in the United States Department of Agriculture's _Soil Survey of Douglas County, Kansas_ dated 1973. Groundwater elevations and fluctuations for the Eudora-Kimo complex are outlined in the Soil Survey. Seasonal high water tables are more apparent in the months from March to June with elevations generally being greater than six feet below ground surface.  No physical groundwater levels were determined for this report.

At this project location, the ground surface varies from approximately 5 to 8 feet below the top of the levee.  Assuming fully saturated soil with groundwater up to the surface, the groundwater at the project site would be at the ground surface adjacent to the levee or an elevation of 821.00 feet above sea level.

This analysis was performed to determine the head above tailwater or hydraulic gradient at the point of excavations with respect to the levee. Using the equations outlined on the USACE guidance document within the Underseepage section.

This value is used to calculate the factors of safety for piping and heave.

## Table 2: Piping Factor of Safety for a temporary 7 foot deep excavation to elevation of 814.00 feet at a distance of 140 feet from the levee

Per USACE requirements, the factor of safety must be a minimum of 1.5 at the bottom of excavations.

To alleviate the pressure due to floatation under the slab, an interior French drain connected to a sump pump capable of continuously lifting at least 1,200 gallons/hour at least 10 feet should be installed under the slab. The sump should have a back-up pump capable of the same. All of the consumer grade sump pumps available at the local home improvement store are capable of lifting several thousand gallons per hour (2-3 times the requirement).

All crushed stone in the French drain shall be protected and wrapped by a geotextile filter. The introduction of a drainage fabric around the aggregate will prevent in-situ soils from being washed into and clogging the drain. The geotextile filter fabric will prevent soil fines from entering the drainage system, thereby extending drain life and increasing performance.

The French drain gravel should be washed three quarter inch minimum crushed stone. In addition to allowing the water to freely flow to the sump lines and sump pit, it is important to place the gravel around the pipe so as to filter any sediment that the geotextile was not able to remove.

In a worst-case-scenario: if the actual volume of flow exceeds the calculated volume of flow, or the primary and back-up pumps fail, the sump pit will serve as a hydrostatic relief valve on the basement. The basement will flood and the flood waters in the basement will balance any uplift forces.

## Table 9: Designed Uplift Factors of Safety Calculations

With the modified basement design 602,160 pounds of uplift due to floatation are removed from the slab.

## Interim Flood Protection and Contingency Plan

Due to the temporary nature of all probable excavations and the distance from the levee, and low potential for underseepage or uplift, no interim flood protection or contingency plan was prepared.

## General Recommendations and Comments

The analyses and evaluations presented in this report are based on data obtained from maps and publications, and generally accepted engineering practices in accordance with the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) guidance document for work proposed near or within the critical area of federally constructed flood control project. No laboratory testing program or subsurface explorations were performed.  This report does not reflect signification variations that may exist from published documents versus actual subsurface conditions, or variations due to modifying effects of weather.

This report has been prepared for the exclusive use of this site to address the engineering and safety concerns associated with the construction of single-family residence within the critical area of federally constructed flood control project. The analyses and evaluations indicated that uplift pressures due to underseepage and buoyant soil conditions need to be addressed by utilizing the modified basement design detailed in this report.  Factors of safety against piping and heave were shown to greatly exceeded the minimum values specified by the USACE.

While there is low safety risk associated with the construction activities, it is recommended that subsurface excavation depths greater than 30” not occur when the Kansas River is at a flood stage greater than 25 feet.
