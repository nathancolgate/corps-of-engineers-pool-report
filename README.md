Geotechnical Engineering Report

### Project Information and Observations

#### Overview

The single-family residence planned for 872 Oak Street will consist of a 2,400 square foot two-story house, with a basement. The project site, located in the City of Lawrence, Douglas County, Kansas, was historically used for agriculture. No trees exist on the property.

#### Construction

Construction will begin in the spring of 2014 and continue through the summer of 2015. Specific construction activities covered in this report are a basement excavation with a footprint of approximately 1,747 square feet. While the overall project duration is drawn out, the periods during which subsurface excavation activities will occur is no greater than four weeks. Site grading will be limited to that required directly adjacent to new structures for positive drainage.

#### Kansas River Levee Station

The overall project site at its closest point is directly adjacent to the Kansas River levee Station 391+00.

#### Flood Zone

The property lies in Zone X of the FEMA - Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). Zone X represents areas of 500-year flood; 100-year flood with average depth of less than 1 foot or with drainage areas less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by levees from 100-year flood or better.

#### Excavations

The excavations at the closest point are approximately 140’ from the toe and 160’ from the top of the Kansas River levee, with surface elevations between 6 and 7 feet below the top of the levee. The top of the levee is approximately 828.00 feet asl and the ground surface elevation along the landward toe of the levee is approximately 824.00 feet asl.

#### Soils Information

Soil names, descriptions, formation, classifications, and physical and engineering characteristics were obtained from the _United States Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service -- Soil Survey of Douglas County, Kansas_.

Detached boring information and descriptions of soil types, characteristics from soil samples of those borings, levee elevations, and depth to soil stratum layers  were obtained from the _USACE Plan, Profile and Underground Explorations Sta. 346+00 to Sta. 402+00_ dated May 1969. No subsurface explorations or laboratory testing program were specifically performed for this project.

#### Natural Blanket

The uppermost soil stratum at the site is classified by the Soil Survey and the USACE as a silt loam to silty clay loam (ML, CL) described as Eudora-Bismarckgrove complex. The Eudora series consists of deep, well drained, nearly level to gently undulating soils on flood plains, formed in loamy alluvium and for this report will be considered the blanket material.

This soil horizon varies in thickness but average in depth of 16 to 24 feet and greater. For the purpose of this analysis, the blanket thickness has been estimated at 20 feet, with a bottom elevation of 804.00. This is an average of the observed blanket thickness of boring D-77 at STA 385+10 (16 feet) and boring D-78 at STA 394+10 (24 feet).

#### Natural Foundation

The underlying soils for the project site are classified by the Soil Survey as sandy and loamy deposits described as the Riverwash and Sarpy Series Overwash with outcroppings near the lowest level along the Kansas River. This soil horizon varies in thickness but detached borings indicate that the pervious zone averages 30 to 40 feet in thickness. For the purpose of this analysis, the pervious substratum thickness has been estimated at 35’.

#### Kansas River Observations

Kansas River information was obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Weather Service -- Kansas River at Lawrence Flood Stage Gauge located approximately 6,200 feet upstream of the project. 

The most recent water surface elevation at the Kansas River gauge in Lawrence at the time of this report (July 28, 2020) indicated a stage of 13.71 feet with the gauge base elevation at 799.86 feet. The gauge is located at the Highway 59 Bridge connecting 6th and Massachusetts Streets to North Second Street just upstream of the Bowerstock Dam.

The Kansas River normal water elevation below the Bowersock Dam adjacent to the site may vary from 790 to 800 feet asl. 

While this gauge is upstream of the project, the uniform cross-section of the river would indicate that the relative depth of the flood water to height of levee would be equivalent to the section at the project location.  Based on relative elevation of the project site, Kansas River flood stage would need to be at 29 feet to recognize a groundwater elevation equivalent to the lowest point on the crest of the project site levee.

#### Kansas River Flood Impacts

* **34 feet:** Flood waters reach the top of the levee on north side of the river.
* **32.3 feet:** The city of Lawrence Wastewater Treatment building is flooded.
* **28 feet:** Water enters the first floor of the Lawrence Riverfront Mall.
* **27.3 feet:** The City of Lawrence Wastewater Treatment Plant is shut down.
* **21.3 feet:** Sandbagging of the City of Lawrence Waste Water Treatment Plant is necessary.
* **18 feet:** Lowlands outside of the levee on the north side of the river begin to flood. Burcham Park is closed due to flooding on the south side of the river.
* **15 feet:** Burcham Park on the south side of the river begins to flood.

#### Ground Water Observations

Ground water levels were estimated based on information provided in Soil Survey of Douglas County, Kansas. Groundwater elevations and fluctuations for the Eudora-Kimo complex are outlined in the Soil Survey. Seasonal high water tables are more apparent in the months from March to June with elevations generally being greater than six feet below ground surface.  No physical groundwater levels were determined for this report.

At this project location, the ground surface varies from approximately 5 to 8 feet below the top of the levee.  Assuming fully saturated soil with groundwater up to the surface, the groundwater at the project site would be at the ground surface adjacent to the levee or an elevation of 821.00 feet asl.
