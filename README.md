### Project Information and Observations

#### Overview

The development planned for 872 Oak Street will consist of a below ground natural swimming pool (NSP) / pond. The project site, located in the City of Lawrence, Douglas County, Kansas, was historically used for agriculture, and has one existing house with a basement. A few trees exist on the property. Some smaller fruit trees will be removed, but the larger shade trees will remain.

#### Construction

Construction will happen in the fall of 2020. The specific construction activity covered in this report is a pool excavation with a footprint of approximately 2,423 square feet. The period during which subsurface excavation activities will occur is no greater than 2 weeks.

<small>_Figure: The design of the pool indicating the three pool zones and their surface areas_</small>

The pool water will be contained via a water tight liner (EPDM rubber, fiber reinforced polyethylene, or similar type) installed following the manufacturers recommendations.

Due to the liner not being rigid the pool should not be analyzed as a single structure. The liner is incapable of transfering any loads or stresses to other areas of the pool. As such, every point in the pool footprint must be capable of safely addressing uplift and underseepage concerns.

Therefore, for this analysis, the pool was broken into three zones based on their depths:

* **A plant regeneration zone:** 2ft deep with a surface area of 1723.4 ft<sup>2</sup>
* **A shallow zone:** 4ft deep with a surface area of 594.6 ft<sup>2</sup>
* **A deep zone:** 8ft deep with a surface area of 105.5 ft<sup>2</sup>

#### Kansas River Levee Station

The overall project site at its closest point is directly adjacent to the Kansas River levee Station 391+00.

### Subsurface Conditions

#### Soils Information

Soil names, descriptions, formation, classifications, and physical and engineering characteristics were obtained from the _United States Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service -- Soil Survey of Douglas County, Kansas_.

Detached boring information and descriptions of soil types, characteristics from soil samples of those borings, levee elevations, and depth to soil stratum layers  were obtained from the _USACE Plan, Profile and Underground Explorations Sta. 346+00 to Sta. 402+00_ dated May 1969. A laboratory testing program was not specifically performed for this project. A subsurface percolation test was performed on site, as well as a topographical survey.

#### Natural Blanket

The uppermost soil stratum at the site is classified by the Soil Survey and the USACE as a silt loam to silty clay loam (ML-CL) described as Eudora-Bismarckgrove complex. The Eudora series consists of deep, well drained, nearly level to gently undulating soils on flood plains, formed in loamy alluvium.

<small>_Figure: Elevation of boring sites. Relevant borings highlighted in in blue (D-77) and red (D-78)._</small>

This soil horizon varies in thickness but average in depth of 16 to 24 feet and greater. For the purpose of this analysis, the blanket thickness has been estimated at 20 feet, with a bottom elevation of 804.0. This is an average of the observed blanket thickness of boring D-77 at STA 385+10 and boring D-78 at STA 394+10.

The natural riverside blanket is 332.2 feet long.

#### Natural Blanket Saturated Conductivity

The saturated conductivity of Silt Loam (ML) and Silty Clay Loam (CL) is between 0.45 and 0.07 cm/hour. However, an on-site percolation test was conducted at a depth of 3 feet, and found the soil to have a rate of 3.81 cm/hour (more akin to sandy loam soil). For this analysis, sandy loam (SM) will be used for the blanket material.

| Description     |  Value | UOM     |
|-----------------|-------|---------|
| Sand            | 29.70 | cm/hour |
| Loamy Sand      | 14.60 | cm/hour |
| Sandy Loam      | 4.42  | cm/hour |

#### Natural Foundation

The underlying soils for the project site are classified by the Soil Survey as sandy and loamy deposits described as the Riverwash and Sarpy Series Overwash with outcroppings near the lowest level along the Kansas River. This soil horizon varies in thickness but detached borings indicate that the pervious zone averages 30 to 40 feet in thickness. For the purpose of this analysis, the pervious substratum thickness has been estimated at 35 feet, with a bottom elevation of 769.0.

#### Kansas River Observations

Kansas River information was obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Weather Service -- Kansas River at Lawrence Flood Stage Gauge located approximately 6,200 feet upstream of the project. 

The most recent water surface elevation at the Kansas River gauge in Lawrence at the time of this report (July 28, 2020) indicated a stage of 13.71 feet with the gauge base elevation at 799.86 feet. The gauge is located at the Highway 59 Bridge connecting 6th and Massachusetts Streets to North Second Street just upstream of the Bowerstock Dam.  

> Source: Hydrograph for Kansas River at Lawrence Flood Stage Guage [http://water.weather.gov/ahps2/hydrograph.php?wfo=top&gage=lwrk1](http://water.weather.gov/ahps2/hydrograph.php?wfo=top&gage=lwrk1)

The Kansas River normal water elevation below the Bowersock Dam adjacent to the site may vary from 790 to 800 feet above sea level. 

#### Kansas River Flood Impacts

* **34 feet:** Flood waters reach the top of the levee on north side of the river.
* **32.3 feet:** The city of Lawrence Wastewater Treatment building is flooded.
* **28 feet:** Water enters the first floor of the Lawrence Riverfront Mall.
* **27.3 feet:** The City of Lawrence Wastewater Treatment Plant is shut down.
* **21.3 feet:** Sandbagging of the City of Lawrence Waste Water Treatment Plant is necessary.
* **18 feet:** Lowlands outside of the levee on the north side of the river begin to flood. Burcham Park is closed due to flooding on the south side of the river.
* **15 feet:** Burcham Park on the south side of the river begins to flood.

Flood Categories

* **29.0 feet:** Major Flood Stage
* **20.0 feet:** Moderate Flood Stage
* **18.0 feet:** Flood Stage
* **15 feet:** Action Stage

While the Kansas River at Lawrence Flood Stage Gauge is upstream of the project, the uniform cross-section of the river would indicate that the relative depth of the flood water to height of levee would be equivalent to the section at the project location.

For this analysis, uplift values were calculated for an extreme operating condition of a major flood stage in which the riverside groundwater elevation has reached the top of the levee: 34 feet, with an elevation of 828.3.  

#### Ground Water Observations

Ground water levels were estimated based on information provided in the United States Department of Agriculture's _Soil Survey of Douglas County, Kansas_ dated 1973. Groundwater elevations and fluctuations for the Eudora-Kimo complex are outlined in the Soil Survey. Seasonal high water tables are more apparent in the months from March to June with elevations generally being greater than six feet below ground surface.  No physical groundwater levels were determined for this report.

At this project location, the ground surface is approximately 6 feet below the top of the levee.  Assuming fully saturated soil with groundwater up to the surface, the landside groundwater at the project site would be at the ground surface adjacent to the levee or an elevation of 822.3 feet above sea level.

## Analysis and Evaluation

This analysis and evaluation was performed to determine a) underseepage of existing levee through pervious substrata, b) uplift pressure or structure load comparison at proposed structure footings, and c) excavation methodology and modifications or preparation if required. The analyses were performed in general accordance with the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) guidance document for work proposed near or within the critical area of federally constructed flood control projects.

Due to outline limits of excavations, analyses or evaluations of the existing levee are outside the scope of this report. No slope stability analyses were performed for the temporary excavations. The responsibility for excavation safety and stability of temporary construction slopes lie solely with the contractor and thus should follow the OSHA regulations given in 29 CFR Part  1926.650-652 Subpart P and any other local, state, and federal regulations for construction safety.

Underseepage Analyses: Underseepage calculations to determine hydraulic grade line through the foundation strata were performed using geotechnical parameters established from the assumed soil and groundwater characteristics. The hydraulic grade line through the existing levee is not part of this analysis. Table 1 shows the elevations and distances used for underseepage analysis.

This analysis was performed to determine the head above tailwater or hydraulic gradient at the point of excavations with respect to the levee. Using the equations outlined on the USACE guidance document within the Underseepage section.

This value is used to calculate the factors of safety for piping and heave.

## Table 2: Piping Factors of Safety

Piping factors of safety were calculated for each zone of the pool:

* Z<sub>regen</sub>: a temporary excavation 1.75 feet below and 31.1 feet north of the landward toe of the levee
* Z<sub>shallow</sub>: a temporary excavation 3.75 feet below and 37.0 feet north of the landward toe of the levee
* Z<sub>deep</sub>: a temporary excavation of 7.75 feet below and 46.0 feet north of the landward toe of the levee

![Site Excavations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nathancolgate/corps-of-engineers-pool-report/master/excavation_detail.png)
<small>_Figure: Excavation detail._</small>

Per USACE requirements, the factor of safety must be a minimum of 1.5 at the bottom of excavations.

## Table 6: Default Uplift Factor of Safety Calculations

A load comparison can be done to determine the factor of safety against floatation. The factor of safety is the ratio of the total weight of the pool, to the uplift forces caused by flood waters on the riverside of the levee system or the presence of a high groundwater table. The minimum uplift factor of safety specified by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at this flood condition is 1.10.

### Pool Excavation Methodology and Design Modifications

Based on the analyses provided in the above sections for underseepage and uplift forces, a modified pool design will be required in order to prevent uplift. Fortuntaly, the standard design for NSPs / ponds already call for lining the pool bottom with rocks. Additional weight will be added to the pool using rocks in the following ways:

1. At least 3 inches of rock will be added to the bottom of the plant regeneration zone
1. At least 9 inches of rock will be added to the bottom of the plant shallow zone
1. At least 22 inches of rock will be added to the bottom of the plant deep zone

To further address uplift pressures when the pool is empty or partially filled, the pool has been designed with a hydrostatic relief valve to allow water to infiltrate the pool when the hydrostatic pressure due to high groundwater levels exceed a differential pressure of 1.0 psi or 2.3 feet of water.

The following table breaks down the additional weight the rocks will add to the pool.

The unit weight of water filled rock was determined to be 119 lbs/ft<sup>3</sup> by an on-site test in which a bucket was filled with the desired rock material, topped off with water, and then weighed and measured.

## Interim Flood Protection and Contingency Plan

Due to the temporary nature of all probable excavations and the distance from the levee, and low potential for underseepage or uplift, no interim flood protection or contingency plan was prepared.

## General Recommendations and Comments

The analyses and evaluations presented in this report are based on data obtained from maps and publications, and generally accepted engineering practices in accordance with the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) guidance document for work proposed near or within the critical area of federally constructed flood control project. No laboratory testing program or subsurface explorations were performed.  This report does not reflect signification variations that may exist from published documents versus actual subsurface conditions, or variations due to modifying effects of weather.

This report has been prepared for the exclusive use of this site to address the engineering and safety concerns associated with the construction of single-family residence within the critical area of federally constructed flood control project. The analyses and evaluations indicated that uplift pressures due to underseepage and buoyant soil conditions need to be addressed by utilizing the modified pool design detailed in this report.  Factors of safety against piping and heave were shown to greatly exceeded the minimum values specified by the USACE.

While there is low safety risk associated with the construction activities, it is recommended that subsurface excavation depths greater than 30” not occur when the Kansas River is at a flood stage greater than 25 feet.
